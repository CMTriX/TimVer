Thanks for installing TimVer.

TimVer will display the same Windows version related information as the built-in Winver command, 
plus additional information. The information is displayed in a larger font, for those folks whose 
eyes are just a little bit more experienced.

The information is obtained from Windows Management Information (WMI) and from 
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion in the registry.

All information can be copied to the clipboard by pressing Ctrl + C or by clicking the button on 
the About tab.

To uninstall use the regular Windows add/remove programs feature.  

Tim
